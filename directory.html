    <h1>Prior Classes</h1>
    <h2>During my Junior year, I took Computer Science II, where Mrs.Jang was my teacher. For this course, I applied many of the skills that I had learned in my Computer Science I class, including the introduction of the Swift coding language. Throughout the year, I was involved in many projects such as creating a Sudoku Game, a model class scheduling app for the school, and an Independent project.</h2>
