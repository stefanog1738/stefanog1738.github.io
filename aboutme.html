    <h1 class="aboutmetitle">About Me</h1>
    <h2 class="aboutmeparagraph">Hello! My name is Stefano Giron. I am 17 years old, and currently a senior attending Allen High School. I enjoy working out, watching any type of entertainment online, and of course, working with computers. I have always had an interest in working with technology, whether its on the hardware or software side. Because of this, I have taken many STEM related classes throughout my middle and high school years, where I have explored its many fields, such as programming hardware, coding applications, and graphic design. I have taken computer science classes throughout my high school career, such as Computer Science I, II, and currently III. I have learned various skills and langugaes such as Swift, JavaScript, and C#. I used my knowledge of computer science for many projects inside and outside of school, including creatinig addons for video games, creating a video game, and a model scheduler app. I am planning on pursuing a career in Computer Sciences, either engineering or software related.. I will be using this digital portfolio as a way to document the work and skills that I have learned and participated in. I am always eager to explore something new related to Computer Science, and hope to expand my knowledge to better prepare myself for my life. Thank you for reading!</h2>
