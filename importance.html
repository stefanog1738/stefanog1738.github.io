    <h1>Importance of Digital Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>The Digital Portfolio is significant for me and my future as it is a way for me to be able to document my experiences taking Computer Science Classes, including projects, what I have learned, and how I have used it. It is also a way for me to show potential employers and companies that I want to work for.</h2>
