    <h1 class="titleimportance">Why have a Digital Portfolio?</h1>
    <h2 class="importanceparagraph">This Digital Portfolio is significant for me and my future as it is a way for me to be able to document my Computer Science experience. It can act as a reference if I want to look back at every project I have had related to Computer Science, and how I have used it. This includes my experience in high school by taking Computer Science I, II, III, as well as outside of school. I am constantly learning something new, and this Portfolio can be used to demonstrate my acquired knowledge in the form of class activities, essays, and independent projects. I will be updating my portfolio and reflect on my accomplishments to prepare for my future. This can be be used for my college applcations, and to show potential emplyers and companies that I wish to work for to demonstrate what I have done.</h2>
