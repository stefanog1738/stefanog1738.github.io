      <p class="para">A significant portion of my Computer Science journey through High School is showing how we can apply what we learned in the form of projects, where we may be creating websites, applications, and programs. However, in a team project, there will be disagreements as a result of biases, where something affects our decision making. Biases are present in any type of project, including creating video games with other members.</p>

      <p class="para">One of the biases that can be applied to almost any situation is Confirmation Bias. This bias refers to the tendency for us to side by whatever makes us feel good. Because of this, we purposely try to ignore sides or arguments that we do not agree on, and try to promote/agree with what we agree on (Wilcot). We are humans, and we want to have what makes us happy and feel good, so it would make sense for us to side by what satisfies us. In our project, confirmation bias may occur when a member wants to choose a specific theme song for the main menu, but another member chooses another song because they have different tastes in music. A way to prevent this would be listing down our music preferences, choosing multiple songs based on our preferences, and selecting the one that we all enjoy.</p>

      <p class="para">Every project has someone who leads the rest and assigns them tasks. They tend to be more knowledgeable about the project and know what to do. This would be a big problem to the rest of the members because if an idea is proposed, it may be rejected in favor of an idea that the team leader has. This is known as Authority Bias, where people side with the team leader because they believe they know more (Wilcot). It is reasonable to place trust in someone who is known to be well informed about the subject, but they may not be correct all the time. This is someone that is most applicable to me, as I am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to using apps such as unity and blender to create video games, but I believe that a team member knows more than me. If a situation arises where the team leader proposes an idea, I will have to look at the effects and how it will impact the game in the long run. I would have to ask questions to fully understand their goal. If I believe I have an alternative idea, then I would include it in the plan and see if it is accepted, but I would have to think logically and adjust it if needed.</p>

      <p class="para">Sometimes we have to think outside the box to come up with unique and thoughtful solutions, but when we don't, it could lead to bland creations. Becoming too comfortable with what we already know and not trying other methods could limit our originality. This is known as the Well Traveled Road Effect, which is the tendency to come up with ideas that we know we can accomplish because we know how to do it. This can be applied when creating video games, as I have a lot to learn in blender for creating models and animations (Mateev). To combat this, I could use the internet and watch tutorials on blender and unity strategies, or just use the tools and features available in Unity and Blender to create unique and immersive worlds.</p>

      <p class="para">When creating video games or any program in general for a large audience, it is crucial to make it in a way that everyone can enjoy, not just a small group of people. If we make something that we believe people would enjoy, then it would just lead to receiving positive feedback from a small group of players, while dismissing negative feedback from a larger group of players. This is known as the bullseye fallacy, where we pick ideas because we support what led to its creation rather than considering the opposite view (Mateev). When creating video games, there are certain mechanics involved to make it playable, but there can be many alternatives. To counteract this, we must be able to know that when we propose ideas, that we consider their opposite views. We can ask other team members, or video games players and their preferences on certain game mechanics, such as point of view, controls, and progress time to ensure we know all perspectives.</p>

      <p class="para">When creating video games, it is important to test a certain feature we added to ensure that we can move on to the next goal, and that would involve getting feedback from game testers. For example, if we add a certain game mechanic such as a first person point of view, and we ask a player to test it and they enjoy it, we may conclude that the reason for the player's enjoyment is a result of that specific mechanic, but it may not be the case. This type of situation is called the Illusory Correlation (IResearch). Like in many other situations, Correlation does not imply causation, so it is important to know what the players enjoy. Asking a wide range of players with different gaming preferences would ensure that the mechanic does not lead to all of them enjoying the game, as well as asking for what they could improve on, and prioritizing that.</p>

      <p class="para">Overall, biases are present in many situations, and although it can affect us when we do not think about it, it is important to minimize its influence on us so we can achieve fluent and natural interactions with team members and other people.</p>
