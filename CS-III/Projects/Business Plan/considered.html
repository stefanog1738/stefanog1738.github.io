    <h1 class="considertitle">Buisness Plan Considerations</h1>

    <p class="goose"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/william-hutchings/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF"> Goose Simulator </a></p>
    <h2 class="c2">I considered joining this project because I am a huge fan of simulator games. I have played Goat Simulator and all the spin off games, and I enjoyed them very much. However, I decided not to choose this one because there are multiple versions of the goat simulator on roblox, and I would be compelled to do it if there were unique features presented in the proposal.</h2>

    <p class="bus"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/ryan-hallock/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF"> School Bus Tracker </a></p>
    <h3 class="c3">I strongly considered this project because as someone who has to take shuttle buses to go to the Steam Center and back, it can get frustrating when the buses do not arrive on time, or if some are missing. I also think it is a cool feature for the collaboration districts and getting feedback for extra security. However, I decided not to choose this project as I believe that improvements and feedback are already being made for the transportation system, as the system has been slightly improving since the beginning of the school year. Also, students would not be able to do anything about it if the bus does not show up.</h3>

    <p class="vpn"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/qasem-abdeljaber/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF"> VPN Unblocker </a></p>
    <h4 class="c4">I was instantly intrigued by this proposal as I believe that VPN usage is needed at school. I do like the concept of the VPN unblocking itself, but I think that some paid VPNs already have this feature as it would take too much effort for schools to block the premium versions. Also, there is a way to bypass the school network blocking by opening a VPN first, then connecting. Because of the little effort it would take to use a VPN in school without fear of it being blocked, I chose not to join this project.</h4>

    <p class="face"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/cameron-farley/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF">Facial ID Attendance</a></p>
    <h5 class="c5">This project was interesting to me because it works similarly to the tardy scanners, just with a facial scanner. Also, I believe it would save a lot of time and it would be cool if it could detect when a student is tardy depending on the time. However, I decided not to choose this one because I am concerned about how the facial scanner could be set up, and if it would need the faces of every student who attends the school. Also, I am not sure how it would be better than human error because the tardy scanners have many errors detecting an ID or even working at all. Because facial scanners involve newer technology, it would take a longer time to reach its full potential, meaning that more errors could occur.</h5>

    <p class="zombie"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aaron-berdecia/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF">Zombie Shooter</a></p>
    <h6 class="c6">I like this proposal because I like survival games, with guns and zombies because it can get addicting. Seeing this proposal reminded me of the mobile game Pixel Gun 3D, which I enjoyed playing when I was young. Because of that, I do not find anything unique from this proposal that would make it stand out from other survival gun games, so I decided to reject this proposal.</h6>

    <p class="lunch"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jonathan-gateley/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF">Preordered Lunch</a></p>
    <h7 class="c7">I considered this proposal because I liked the concept of it and how it could work. I do understand the struggle and frustration seeing a lunch line that is extremely long. Initially, I thought that a lot of time could be saved by having lunch ready to go when you immediately enter lunch. However, this could be useless if a lot of people were to use this feature, causing the pre ordered lunch line to fill up. Therefore, I decided not to join this project seeing that it could cause more problems in the future if more people were to use it.</h7>

    <p class="tutor"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/rupak-bhattacharya/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF">Global Tutoring</a></p>
    <h8 class="c8">I considered this proposal because I believe people would benefit from learning from other people, and try new methods. As someone who takes advanced classes, I understand the struggle and stress of trying to learn new content and skills for each subject. However, I believe that this could cause more problems as you learn from multiple people. I think that if you have multiple tutors, each of them could have their own strategies and students would get overwhelmed about which one would be the best. Also, I prefer learning content from people or videos online rather than skills because it would cause even more confusion if I learn from multiple people, so I decided not to join this project.</h8>

    <p class="skyward"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/muqadam-sabir/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF">Better Skyward</a></p>
    <h9 class="c9">I considered this proposal because I believe that there should be improvements to the current layout and features of Skyward. I think that features such as the interface itself, lag, and navigation can be improved, and it wouldn't take a lot of time to do it. With that in mind, I am not compelled enough to join this project because I do not believe that a lot of time would be needed to solve this issue, and there is nothing in the proposal that seems unique in terms of what new features could be added.</h9>

    <p class="ware"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/farhan-ishraque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF">Predationware</a></p>
    <h10 class="c10">I considered this proposal because I believe that parts of having a good gaming experience requires owning a high end pc that can run all sorts of games. I do play video games, and get frustrated whenever I experience internal issues such as input delay, frame drops, and slow loading times. However, I decided not to pursue this project because I realized that there are many more factors that are involved in the gaming experience, such as keyboards, desks, mouses, and monitors. There are already many shops online, such as CyberPower PC that are involved in this type of business, so I do not see anything that makes Predationware stand out. Also, having an advantage over other players because of their higher end pc is always going to be a problem because you would have to buy a high end computer, which would cost a lot of money, and a lot of players would not be able to do that.</h10>

    <p class="tower"><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/suhraab-alimi/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" style="color: #FFFFFF">Stefano Tower Defense Game</a></p>
    <h11 class="c11">I was drawn to this project because not only does it involve a character with my name, but I am a huge fan of tower defense games. I have played video games in this Genre for many years such as the Plants vs Zombies franchise, and Bloons Tower Defense, and I find it addicting. The proposal also sticks out from other Tower Defense games because there is a story to it, as well as hidden easter eggs. Another feature that I am intrigued about is that the game will include problem solving skills, and the players would need to have a fast reaction time to succeed, which can be used in the real world. Because of my obsession with tower defense games, and enjoying a good story, I decided to choose this project as my ISP.</h11>
