    <h1 class="buisnesstitle">Buisness Plan</h1>

    <h2 class="b2">Identity</h2>
    <h12 class="b12"> Our plan consists of creating an automated program that would allow the mouse and keyboard to function on its own based on whatt the user wants to be done</h12> 

    <h3 class="b3">Problem</h3>
    <h13 class="b13">People who may not have a lot of time to do a task or the same tasks everyday may not want to do it again and again. For example, wanting to print a schedule that is sent to you every week from work or important documents could be time consuming depending on how many there are. People would rather not want to spend a lot of time on their computer completing tasks that could be done with simple clicks and typing.</h13>

    <h4 class="b4">Solution</h4>
    <h14 class="b14">People would want to have a program that could run scripts or automated processes that they can complete everyday tasks, such as printing or sending messages. Our solution would be to create a program that a user could create or have the program detect buttons that will auto click, as well as using a keyboard to type automated messages.</h14>
    
    <h5 class="b5">Target Market</h5>
    <h15 class="b15">The target audience would be people with jobs that require regular everyday tasks who may not have a lot of time to complete it.</h15>

    <h6 class="b6">Competition</h6>
    <h16 class="b16">Although there are many types of automated clickers or macros, this program will be composed of a system that copies mouse movement and keyboard input for specific windows, similar to an AI, and try to copy it. Additionally, our program will be able to include options such as how fast the task could be completed, and a schedule, so it could be run at certain times of the day.</h16>

    <h7 class="b7">Revenue</h7>
    <h17 class="b17">Putting advertisements in the program itself could generate revenue. There could also be another version that would have the user pay a one time fee to remove the ads.</h17>

    <h8 class="b8">Marketing Activites</h8>
    <h18 class="b18">Advertising this program to people at jobs or social media would be the best way for reaching more people</h18>

    <h9 class="b9">Expenses</h9>
    <h19 class="b19">Expenses would include having a website that we could advertise to people, and managing a domain name for the program, further expenses could arise as time goes by.</h19>

    <h10 class="b10">Team and Key Roles</h10>
    <h20 class="b20">Right now, Stefano is the only team member, but as more people join, new roles such as creating the website, illustrator, and someone who can make scripts will be available.</h20>

    <h11 class="b11">milestones</h11>
    <h21 class="b21">Ssome milestones would include the creation of a mouse script or ai, a keyboard script or ai, the creation of the program, and when the program can run simple keyboard and mouse tasks that the user sets</h21>
