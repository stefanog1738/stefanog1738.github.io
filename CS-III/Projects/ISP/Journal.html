    <h1 class="jour">24-Apr-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Issue 1</h1>

    <p class="journal"> The sniper tower will need to include features such as detecting enemies from all over the map, and it attacks having no delay in terms of when it shoots and when it impacts the enemy.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Issue 2</h1>

    <p class="journal">My goal this week is to help with completing the UI for the tower scenes, such as the winning and losing scene. Additionally, specific buttons for each tower will need to be implementedthat allow them to make a certain attack/move.</p>
    
    
    <h1 class="jour">17-Apr-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Issue 1</h1>

    <p class="journal"> Create the 7th tower which will require work from every member. </p>

    <h1 class="jour">Issue 2</h1>

    <p class="journal"> Implement all features of the tower into the game, which includes animation, projectiles, movement, upgrades, and pricing.</p>
    
    
    <h1 class="jour">10-Apr-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week, our goal was to finish the star tower. After this tower, there would only be 1 more tower to complete as our goal was only to have 7 towers. It took a while to complete it, as we had to implement animation, projectiles, pricing, upgrades, and attacks.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Since there were no meeting this week, there were no issues in terms of dates or when our work should be completed by.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1> 

    <p class="journal">Our work was mostly individual this week, as we did not need assistance from other member to complete our work.<p>
    
    <h1 class="jour">03-Apr-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week, we were continuing to improve our towers such as the disco and snow towers, which throw projectiles at the enemies. The only issues we had were trying to figure out how to calculate the prices for each upgrade to the towers, as they are based on the price of the tower.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">There were not any scheduling challenges this week as we were all given the goals we had to fulfill earlier in the week.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">I did not have any meetings with the other members in the group. Therefore, there were no issues in terms of working with others.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">27-Mar-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week, I was assigned with creating the structure of the rounds and when the bosses would appear. This means that I did not have to work on the back end side, but more of adding enemy types and formatting the rounds. I also had to calculate the amount of money/cash the player would earn each round, as well as the sell value for each tower.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Our assigned work was given to us at he beginning of the week via discord, and we did not have any meetings this week. Additionally, we did not have to meet to discuss what had to complete next, giving us more time to improve our previous works.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">The only interactions I had this week was asking for specific directions from a team member as I did not understand what they wanted me to do. Other than that, I had not interactions with members this week.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">20-Mar-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week I was assigned with creating moabs type enemies, which servers as a boss for the ending rounds, and would progress the story if they were defeated. I was challenge because I had to use my head and enlarge it in a way that would make it different from the other enemies that used my head, so I changed the color grading.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Because I only had to work on creating a new type of enemy, I did not have to meet with other members to discuss how I was going to accomplish this goal. There were not meetings this week, so we did not ahve challenges with finishing our goals on time.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Because I was assigned only one task, I did not have to talk to any other members to as for help. This also means that my work this week was not difficult, so I had not challenges with other members of the team.</p>

    <p class="journal"><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-TowerDefense/commit/445d95d3314491e74e104d34eadcbb0326841d9d" style="color: #FFFFFF">Significant Achievement 1</a></h1>

    <h1 class="jour">13-Mar-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week, I was assigned with the task of creating different enemmy counts and increasing the difficulty of the rounds in intervals of 10. This means that for every 10 rounds, the types of enemies and the clusters that they come in increased, therfore making the rounds harder.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">We did not have ae scheduled meeting this week as the tasks given for each team member were already given. We used discord as a way of communicating via messages, but we did not have a group call.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Our work did not intervene with he work of others this week, so we did not have any interpersonal challenges.</p>

<p class="journal"><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-TowerDefense/commit/1eaa4a2c47c020f29d5499b40ff4c267640cbd51" style="color: #FFFFFF">Significant Achievement 1</a></h1>

    <h1 class="jour">06-Mar-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">The technical challenges I had this week involved the actual game mechanics. We tried to make the mechanics of earning cash, losing lives, and progressing the round work properly for the game. Additionally the buttons for the dancing map were not changing based on the buttons pressed, and which tiles would change. Eventually though, we were able to fix this while working together.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal"> Just like the past work week, we did not schedule any meetings this week. Since we all knew what we were tasked with, scheduling challenges were non existent this week.<p/>

      <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

      <p class="journal">This week, we worked together on the dancing map, and tried to resolve the issue with the buttons and their connection with the map layout. We also tried to fix the game mechanics, but we were able to fix it successfully.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">27-Feb-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">The only assignment I had this week was creating animations for the dance floor map, which included switching the colors around, and transitioning from the squares to rectangles. There was also the addition of puzzles, which changed based on specific two towers placed together.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">There were not any challenges this week. We did not have meetings this week, but we knew what we had to complete by the end of the week.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Since we had individual assignments this week, our work did not overlap or get in the way of the other member's work. Because of this, there were no challenges between teammates this week.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">20-Feb-2023</h1>
    
    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Some technical challenges that we had was how we neeeded to make a dialogue system for the characters as well as what they were going to say for the game. We tried to make it perfect with no bugs, which was pretty difficult. We had to make many tests so that were could perfect it.</p>
    
    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">We did not have many challeneges in the schedule as we only had 1 meeting. In it, we discussed what work we had to get done by the end of the week.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">The only challenge we had this week was how we were discussing what goal we had for the end of the week. We had more issues last week due to the amount of work needed, but we were able to complete the goals successfully.</p>
    
    <h1 class="jour">13-Feb-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week, I was assigned to connect a placement script that was made a while ago, where we had to use the selecting script and connect the button to the selection functionality. This was difficult as there were still some glitches present where selecting a tower type would get unselected, preventing a tower from being placed. In the end, we were able to complete this functionality in time.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Because we had to focus on the class work where we had to use GitHub to interact with our issues and commit our work from Unity into the GitHub repository, we experienced several problems where we needed help to finish the work we were assigned for the team, thus delaying the completing of everything.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week we had many struggles involving our assignments, where we had to wait for each member to commit, and make their issues so we could collaborate on them. Additionally, we could not find a way to properly choose which tasks to work on for each member, which wasted time, but we eventually found a way to make it work by using a spinner.</p>
    
    <h1 class="jour">06-Feb-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">The challenges that I experienced this week involved the specific lines of code for our towers. Creating a tower in Unity involves many tasks, such as creating the model, animation, and functions, which may be exclusive to the tower. I am more experienced in creating animations through blender, and while it is similar to animating in Unity, I am still not familiar with the UI. It may take a while to add all the towers that we made through a model, and incorporate animations, moves, but we are working steadily.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week we did not experience many scheduling challenges when it comes to working on the code, since we are able to work on the project individually. However, when it comes to issues with the code or animation, it may take a while to inform the other members and let them move to the next step when there is a bug. Because of some inconveniences with meeting up and external factors, we may have to cut off a few features to keep up with our schedule.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Sometimes our lack of communication interferes with our work and moving on to the next steps.This week, for instance, we did not talk about how we should split the work and which towers to work on. Eventually, we were able to meet up and talk about what we should do. I was tasked with creating the idle animations and how each tower should attack. This allowed our work productivity to increase as we knew what we had to do.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">23-Jan-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>
    
    <p class="journal">This week, some of the technical challenges we had involved bugs in our code. The code would allow specific functions, such as selecting a tower type, dragging with the mouse, and using an overlay for the tower movement. A specific instance of this was when we tried to select a tower and move it across the play space to place it, and for some reason it would deselect. This eventually was fixed when we met together and came up with a solution.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">This week, we had an unexpected incident with the snow storm, which caused a lot of miscommunation. Since we finished the setting up part of the project, we were able to work individually, and we agree to have at least one meeting per to to discuss to progress.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">There were some disagreements with specific functions involving tower placement. This arised because we wanted to distinguish our game with the original Bloons TD game mechanics. Although we wanted to have another method of placing towers from the original game, it would not really work because it would cause confusion with the player and where to place the tower. Eventually, we came up with the idea of only having the tower show up in a placeable area.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">16-Jan-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Some of the challenges that we encountered while setting up our ISP as Plastic SCM. Because of our lack of knowledge of PlasticSCM, it took several attempts to connect the project with all members of the group. This was caused by some of us having different versions of the program, or accepting the invitation to join the group. We were able to fix this issue by reinstalling the program all together and getting the same versions.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">In order to fix the issue of setting up PlasticSCM, all the members had to be present so that we would know what to do to join the project. There were many external factors that prevented us to meet together but eventually we were able to do it and come up with a solution.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Some of the issues that we had with each other involved the story of the game and how it should be played. This included disagreements with specific towers, different style of levels, and the overall story. While this issue was not fully resolved this week, we are continuing to work together to come up with alternative solutions or try new features.</p>
    
    <h1 class="jour">9-Jan-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">We have encuntered many challenges when it comes to the back end and making sure that our project is working as it should be. It mainly involves our Unity Project and connecting it to various sources, such as GitHub, and with each other through PlasticSCM. This was an issue that I have encountered for my previous ISP as I used Unity in it. This would also cause more challenges when updating our repository in GitHub, as the files in Unity are too large, especially when creating a video game, so it would take longer to load and update. Additionally, our knowledge of the coding languages used in Unity is low, especially for me, so it may prevent efficient methods and lines of code in Unity. However, learning the coding languages is something that I would have to do in my own time to make sure I am improving my knowledge.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">When working on the project, it is important to make sure that we have good communication where we can discuss what we have completed and what the next step in the process of creating the video game is. This would require everyone in the team having time to meet together, which may be difficult because we have different Computer Science Classes and other subjects to work on. If we want to make sure we can collaborate at the same time, we should set up ISP meetings days in advance to discuss the project. We can also use online platforms such as Discord if we are unable to meet in person.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Challenges may arise between the members on ideas and work. This would include creative differences, where we may have different ideas on where we want the story of the game to go, or functionalities. It can get frustrating when we have a deadline and are not working efficiently on our individual tasks, causing the deadline to be missed. This would impact other team members that may require features creating by other members to move on. Additionally, some members are more familiar than me when it comes to coding in Unity, which would cause me to get stressed and possibly miss a deadline. A way to encounter theses challenges would be brainstorming ideas on the story and functions of the game, coming up with the final ideas together, and giving tasks that are based on the knowledge of coddng languages to members.
    
    <h1 class="jour">2-Jan-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">(Software) Development Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The Developmental engineer is responsible for many tasks, including working in the front end by creating the visuals for the product itself that will be shown to the tester or customer, or the back end such as maintaining the web servers, networks, and coding that would be responsible for making sure the finished product is working as intended to. I think I would be suitable for this role because I have experience working both in the front and back end of projects. I like to make sure the visuals and interfaces are appealing to the user, and I would be able to expand my knowledge within coding and the server side. However, if I was to be put in the back end role, I think I would struggle a lot because I am not the best in terms of implementing different coding languages to the video game. Learning the coding language skills is something that I would have to do in my own time.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">QA Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The job of the QA Engineer is to ensure that a product is working as intended so that it could move onto the next process. This would include testing the product for errors in the code, or in the case of video games, watching out for glitches that affect performance and playthrough. This role is significant because it ensures that the audience using the product is experiencing the best version of the product. I believe I am most suited for this role because I am someone that wants to deliver the best work possible, which includes looking for errors. However, I may experience issues in terms of coming up with creative solutions, as well as pointing out issues that are insignificant just to point them out. Spending time focusing on certain aspects or mechanics of the game would prevent distractions, as well as getting as much information from the developers as possible before conducting the testing.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Project Manager</h1>

    <p class="journal">The project manager role is to ensure the efficiency of the software, as well as creating plans, deadlines, and good problem solving skills. They must be able to lead the team and make sure that the product is completed and executed. I think I might be suited for this role because I think I can create plans and solutions for the problems that may be encountered, as well as communicate with other teammates. However, I believe that I may find issues as I am not familiar with every role that is provided in the project, as well as coming up with tasks for each member, which could cause stress. I think the best way to solve this would be being comfortable with the team members and using tools for scheduling and planning.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Product Manager</h1>

    <p class="journal">The product manager looks at the project as a whole, where they have to assist the members in terms of guiding them that they believe is the best for the finished product. They must ensure that the goals are being met, prioritizing certain features, and overall vision. I think I would be suited for this role because I like to create a good sophisticated plan on how the product should be set for release, and also because I believe I can set priorities for the members based on my ideas for the game, which I already have. I would face challenges as I think it would be difficult to manage each member and give them ideas that they would also agree with. But I think having good communication with them would allow me to come up with better ideas.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Release Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The release manager is the role that focuses the most on a smooth release and experience of the product. This would include coming up with scheduled release dates for testing, managing the flow of code, and working with GitHub and git branching through organization. I think I am well suited for this role because I have a good understanding of GitHub and how to implement the code with Unity as I have done it in the past. However, I think issues could arise when errors are caused that I don't even know about or know how to fix, as well as the overall stress knowing that the team is dependent on me for the release of the product. Even though the job requires a high level of organization and knowledge of GitHub, researching online for GitHub tutorials could help with this.</p>
