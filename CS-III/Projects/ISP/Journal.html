    <h1 class="jour">(Software) Development Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The Developmental engineer is responsible for many tasks, including working in the front end by creating the visuals for the product itself that will be shown to the tester or customer, or the back end such as maintaining the web servers, networks, and coding that would be responsible for making sure the finished product is working as intended to. I think I would be suitable for this role because I have experience working both in the front and back end of projects. I like to make sure the visuals and interfaces are appealing to the user, and I would be able to expand my knowledge within coding and the server side. However, if I was to be put in the back end role, I think I would struggle a lot because I am not the best in terms of implementing different coding languages to the video game. Learning the coding language skills is something that I would have to do in my own time.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">QA Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The job of the QA Engineer is to ensure that a product is working as intended so that it could move onto the next process. This would include testing the product for errors in the code, or in the case of video games, watching out for glitches that affect performance and playthrough. This role is significant because it ensures that the audience using the product is experiencing the best version of the product. I believe I am most suited for this role because I am someone that wants to deliver the best work possible, which includes looking for errors. However, I may experience issues in terms of coming up with creative solutions, as well as pointing out issues that are insignificant just to point them out. Spending time focusing on certain aspects or mechanics of the game would prevent distractions, as well as getting as much information from the developers as possible before conducting the testing.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Project Manager</h1>

    <p class="journal">The project manager role is to ensure the efficiency of the software, as well as creating plans, deadlines, and good problem solving skills. They must be able to lead the team and make sure that the product is completed and executed. I think I might be suited for this role because I think I can create plans and solutions for the problems that may be encountered, as well as communicate with other teammates. However, I believe that I may find issues as I am not familiar with every role that is provided in the project, as well as coming up with tasks for each member, which could cause stress. I think the best way to solve this would be being comfortable with the team members and using tools for scheduling and planning.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Product Manager</h1>

    <p class="journal">The product manager looks at the project as a whole, where they have to assist the members in terms of guiding them that they believe is the best for the finished product. They must ensure that the goals are being met, prioritizing certain features, and overall vision. I think I would be suited for this role because I like to create a good sophisticated plan on how the product should be set for release, and also because I believe I can set priorities for the members based on my ideas for the game, which I already have. I would face challenges as I think it would be difficult to manage each member and give them ideas that they would also agree with. But I think having good communication with them would allow me to come up with better ideas.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Release Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The release manager is the role that focuses the most on a smooth release and experience of the product. This would include coming up with scheduled release dates for testing, managing the flow of code, and working with GitHub and git branching through organization. I think I am well suited for this role because I have a good understanding of GitHub and how to implement the code with Unity as I have done it in the past. However, I think issues could arise when errors are caused that I don't even know about or know how to fix, as well as the overall stress knowing that the team is dependent on me for the release of the product. Even though the job requires a high level of organization and knowledge of GitHub, researching online for GitHub tutorials could help with this.</p>
