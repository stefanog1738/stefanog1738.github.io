    <h1 class="isptitle">ISP Journal</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">9-Jan-2023</h1>

    <h1 class="jour">Technical Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">We have encuntered many challenges when it comes to the back end and making sure that our project is working as it should be. It mainly involves our Unity Project and connecting it to various sources, such as GitHub, and with each other through PlasticSCM. This was an issue that I have encountered for my previous ISP as I used Unity in it. This would also cause more challenges when updating our repository in GitHub, as the files in Unity are too large, especially when creating a video game, so it would take longer to load and update. Additionally, our knowledge of the coding languages used in Unity is low, especially for me, so it may prevent efficient methods and lines of code in Unity. However, learning the coding languages is something that I would have to do in my own time to make sure I am improving my knowledge.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Scheduling Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">When working on the project, it is important to make sure that we have good communication where we can discuss what we have completed and what the next step in the process of creating the video game is. This would require everyone in the team having time to meet together, which may be difficult because we have different Computer Science Classes and other subjects to work on. If we want to make sure we can collaborate at the same time, we should set up ISP meetings days in advance to discuss the project. We can also use online platforms such as Discord if we are unable to meet in person.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Interpersonal Challenges</h1>

    <p class="journal">Challenges may arise between the members on ideas and work. This would include creative differences, where we may have different ideas on where we want the story of the game to go, or functionalities. It can get frustrating when we have a deadline and are not working efficiently on our individual tasks, causing the deadline to be missed. This would impact other team members that may require features creating by other members to move on. Additionally, some members are more familiar than me when it comes to coding in Unity, which would cause me to get stressed and possibly miss a deadline. A way to encounter theses challenges would be brainstorming ideas on the story and functions of the game, coming up with the final ideas together, and giving tasks that are based on the knowledge of coddng languages to members.

    <h1 class="jour">(Software) Development Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The Developmental engineer is responsible for many tasks, including working in the front end by creating the visuals for the product itself that will be shown to the tester or customer, or the back end such as maintaining the web servers, networks, and coding that would be responsible for making sure the finished product is working as intended to. I think I would be suitable for this role because I have experience working both in the front and back end of projects. I like to make sure the visuals and interfaces are appealing to the user, and I would be able to expand my knowledge within coding and the server side. However, if I was to be put in the back end role, I think I would struggle a lot because I am not the best in terms of implementing different coding languages to the video game. Learning the coding language skills is something that I would have to do in my own time.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">QA Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The job of the QA Engineer is to ensure that a product is working as intended so that it could move onto the next process. This would include testing the product for errors in the code, or in the case of video games, watching out for glitches that affect performance and playthrough. This role is significant because it ensures that the audience using the product is experiencing the best version of the product. I believe I am most suited for this role because I am someone that wants to deliver the best work possible, which includes looking for errors. However, I may experience issues in terms of coming up with creative solutions, as well as pointing out issues that are insignificant just to point them out. Spending time focusing on certain aspects or mechanics of the game would prevent distractions, as well as getting as much information from the developers as possible before conducting the testing.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Project Manager</h1>

    <p class="journal">The project manager role is to ensure the efficiency of the software, as well as creating plans, deadlines, and good problem solving skills. They must be able to lead the team and make sure that the product is completed and executed. I think I might be suited for this role because I think I can create plans and solutions for the problems that may be encountered, as well as communicate with other teammates. However, I believe that I may find issues as I am not familiar with every role that is provided in the project, as well as coming up with tasks for each member, which could cause stress. I think the best way to solve this would be being comfortable with the team members and using tools for scheduling and planning.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Product Manager</h1>

    <p class="journal">The product manager looks at the project as a whole, where they have to assist the members in terms of guiding them that they believe is the best for the finished product. They must ensure that the goals are being met, prioritizing certain features, and overall vision. I think I would be suited for this role because I like to create a good sophisticated plan on how the product should be set for release, and also because I believe I can set priorities for the members based on my ideas for the game, which I already have. I would face challenges as I think it would be difficult to manage each member and give them ideas that they would also agree with. But I think having good communication with them would allow me to come up with better ideas.</p>

    <h1 class="jour">Release Engineer</h1>

    <p class="journal">The release manager is the role that focuses the most on a smooth release and experience of the product. This would include coming up with scheduled release dates for testing, managing the flow of code, and working with GitHub and git branching through organization. I think I am well suited for this role because I have a good understanding of GitHub and how to implement the code with Unity as I have done it in the past. However, I think issues could arise when errors are caused that I don't even know about or know how to fix, as well as the overall stress knowing that the team is dependent on me for the release of the product. Even though the job requires a high level of organization and knowledge of GitHub, researching online for GitHub tutorials could help with this.</p>
