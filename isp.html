    <h1>Independent Service Project</h1>
    <h2>My ISP project is about a fightning game, similar to Super Smash Brothers. In this game, there are different and original characters from different medias, such as Batman, and a Pizza Guy. There are even special moves for individual characters, and unique animations for the moves. I was primarily motivated to create a game like this because I usually enjoy video games that involve fighting other characters, so when my partner came up with the idea for this, I was immediately hooked. Overall, I enjoyed making this game as it took a lot of planning to create the characters and moves. I spent a large amount of time trying to learn how to use blender for creating the models and animation, as well as Unity to create the game itself. There are a lot of issues that I came across, such as finding out a way to send our progress to our teammates, and longer loading times. </h2>

    <h3> This specific segment of code allows for the character selection to work. By default, the screen would load a character automatically, but the void is able to be accessed by other classes for the previous and next character, allowing for the action of changing the value to an assigned character to move to the next.</h3>

    <h4> This specific segment of code activates moves(). When it is activated, it will perform different actions, including animations that were created in blender and implemented into unity, and delays for the next move so that the action can be completed.</h4>
